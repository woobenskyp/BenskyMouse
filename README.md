# BenskyMouse

BenskyMouse is an app that allows you to use your phone as a trackpad for your PC. 

All you need to use it is have your phone and your computer in the same wifi network, then scan the QR code that shows up in the app to go to the trackpad interface in your phone's browser, Then you can start using it as though it was a trackpad. 

It uses a simple websocket server to receive your finger's position on your phone's screen to change the position of computer's cursor.

Have fun!
